Dr.Poomagal S,60,4,3,A novel method for clustering tweets in twitter,A popular social networking service called Twitter is used to post short messages that could be useful to someone in the world. These messages have been analysed by the researchers in different ways. This paper proposes a clustering technique to cluster the tweets in the Twitter. The basic aim of performing this clustering is to identify the groups of similar tweets posted and this information is useful to identify various user communities. These user communities can be recommended to the advertisers in Twitter by matching their topic of interest with the advertisers' field. Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm is the core web documents clustering algorithm which groups similar documents into clusters by constructing suffix tree. We used STC along with semantic similarity among the posted tweets to identify the topics of interest. The proposed method is compared with STC and Lingo algorithms using intraâ€“cluster â€¦,11

Dr.Poomagal S,60,4,3,A novel method for selecting initial centroids in K-means clustering algorithm,"In data mining, clustering is a method of grouping similar points together. This grouping can be done using partitioning or hierarchical clustering algorithms. K-means is one of the partitioning clustering algorithms which is simple and faster than other clustering algorithms. Major drawbacks of K-means algorithm are the selection of initial centroids and number of clusters (K). This paper aims at providing a solution for selecting initial centroids in which a new point is calculated at each iteration and the point in the dataset which is closest to the calculated point is selected as the centroid. The performance of the proposed work is compared with existing methods using four datasets collected from UCI repository.

This searching time can be reduced by clustering search results into clusters so that the user can select the relevant cluster at a glance by looking at the cluster labels. For web page clustering, terms (features) can be extracted from different parts of the web page. Giansalvatore, Salvatore and Alessandro have extracted terms from the entire web page for clustering.

To reduce the size of the vector, Stanis law Osinski et al., and Ahmed Sameh and Amar Kadray have considered terms from the snippets.",11
Dr.Poomagal S,60,4,3,A novel Tag Score (T_S) model with improved K-means for clustering tweets,"Clustering of tweets is useful for analyzing the attitudes of people towards a particular product. The companies can use this analysis to modify their products to meet the needs of people. Recently, K-means clustering is widely used to cluster the tweets with bag of words as a feature set. The key factors contributing to the quality of clusters and performance of clustering are dimensionality reduction and initial selection of centroids. This paper addresses these issues using a newly proposed Tag Score (T_S) model with improved K-means in which semantically similar features from bag of words are grouped into tags, scores are modified based on sentiment polarity values and the initial centroids are selected with the help of sentiment scores. The performance of the proposed T_S model with improved K-means is compared with T_S model with random K-means and conventional word vectors with random K â€¦",11
Dr.Poomagal S,60,4,3,Cosine similarity-based PageRank calculation,"This paper introduces a new method for calculating the rank of a web page based on the content similarity and the link structure. There are different ranking algorithms available in the literature to calculate the importance score of web pages. The basis of all ranking algorithms is the link structure of the web. Since links from similar documents are more important than the links from other dissimilar documents, combining content similarity with link structure assigns higher ranks to more relevant documents.

Dr.Poomagal S,60,4,3,"Sentiment Thesaurus, Synset and Word2Vec Based Improvement in Bigram Model for Classifying Product Reviews","Classifying product reviews is one of the tasks in Natural Language Processing by which the sentiment of the reviewer towards a product can be identified. This identification is useful for the growth of the business by increasing the number of satisfied customers through product quality improvement. Bigram models are more popular in performing this classification since it considers the occurrence of two words consecutively in the reviews. In the existing works on bigram models, semantically similar words to the words present in bigrams are not considered. As the reviewers use different words with the same meaning to express their feeling, we proposed improved bigram models in which semantically similar words to the words in bigrams are also used for classifying the reviews. In the proposed models, sentiment polarity thesaurus is constructed by including sentiment words and their synonyms. The combinations of â€¦",11

The key factors contributing to improving classification performance are proper feature weights and less number of dimensions. To improve feature weights, a novel feature weight modification technique is proposed which is based on sentiment scores of the Synset words of input set of words. And to reduce the number of dimensions, we used Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) technique. From the results, it is proved that the proposed method of modifying weights gives significant improvement in classification performance",11

Dr.Thilaga M,154,8,4,FP-GraphMiner-A Fast Frequent Pattern Mining Algorithm for Network Graphs.,"In recent years, graph representations have been used extensively for modelling complicated structural information, such as circuits, images, molecular structures, biological networks, weblogs, XML documents and so on. As a result, frequent subgraph mining has become an important subfield of graph mining. This paper presents a novel Frequent Pattern Graph Mining algorithm, FP-GraphMiner, that compactly represents a set of network graphs as a Frequent Pattern Graph (or FP-Graph). This graph can be used to efficiently mine frequent subgraphs including maximal frequent subgraphs and maximum common subgraphs. The algorithm is space and time efficient requiring just one scan of the graph database for the construction of the FP-Graph, and the search space is significantly reduced by clustering the subgraphs based on their frequency of occurrence. A series of experiments performed on sparse, dense and complete graph data sets and a comparison with MARGIN, gSpan and FSMA using real time network data sets confirm the efficiency of the proposed FP-GraphMiner algorithm.",16
Dr.Thilaga M,154,8,4,Minimum connected componentâ€“a novel approach to detection of cognitive load induced changes in functional brain networks,"Recent advances in computational neuroscience have enabled trans-disciplinary researchers to address challenging tasks such as the identification and characterization of cognitive function in the brain. The application of graph theory has contributed to the modelling and understanding the brain dynamics. This paper presents a new approach based on a special graph theoretic concept called minimum connected component (MCC) to detect cognitive load induced changes in functional brain networks using EEG data. The results presented in this paper clearly demonstrate that the MCC based analysis of the functional brain networks derived from multi-channel EEG data is able to detect and quantify changes across the scalp in response to specific cognitive tasks.

Dr.Thilaga M,154,8,4,Breaking the Camel's Back: Can Cognitive Overload be Quantified in the Human Brain?,"Reductionism lies at the heart of science, yet this pre-occupation with the trees may mean that cognitive science is missing the forest. Based on the assumption that individual cognitive and perceptual processes interact to form bottle-necks of processing, which, in turn, have measurable detrimental effects on human performance, whole-head continuous EEG was recorded as participants undertook baseline, mild cognitive load and heavy cognitive load tasks. Behavioral measures (reaction times and error rates) showed significant performance decrements between the mild and heavy cognitive load conditions. Graph analysis and pattern identification was then used to identify a sub-set of cortical locations reflecting significant, measurable neural differences between the mild and heavy cognitive load states. This thus lays the foundation for future research into suitable metrics for more accurately measuring degree of â€¦",16

Unraveling the activity of the brain's billions of neurons and how they combine to form functional networks has been and remains restricted by both technological and ethical constraints; thus, researchers are increasingly turning to sophisticated data search techniques such as complex network clustering and graph mining algorithms to further delve into the hidden workings of the human mind.

Dr.Thilaga M,154,8,4,A novel approach for detection and elimination of automorphic graphs in graph databases,"Graphs have become indispensable in modeling and representing complicated structured data such as proteins, chemical compounds, and XML documents. Development of graph databases for use in research and development is a well-established activity in pharmaceutical and chemical industries. Storing the graphs into large databases is a challenging task as it deals with efficient space and time management. Unlike item sets in huge transactional databases, it becomes essential to ensure the consistency of graph databases since relationships among edges of a graph are predominant. One of the necessary procedures required is a mechanism to check whether two graphs are automorphic. For graphs with more than one vertex with the same label, more than one adjacency matrix representations are possible based on the ordering of vertices with identical labels and there are possibilities that the same graph is stored more than once using different adjacency matrices, leading to adverse results in mining graph databases. Difficulty in identifying and eliminating the automorphic graphs is a challenging problem to the research community. In this paper, a proficient algorithm is devised that efficiently detects and avoids the same graph getting stored into the database. The computational time is also substantially reduced compared to the canonical labeling approach used in Frequent Subgraph Discovery algorithm. The experimental results and comparisons offer a positive response to the newly proposed algorithm.",16

One such avenue, as described in the current paper, involves spanning subgraphs called Minimum Connected Components (MCC) that contain only the influential connections of such networks. This paper investigates cognitive load driven changes across different brain regions using these MCC sub-graphs constructed for different states of brain functioning under different degrees of cognitive load using the graph theoretic concept of clique. The presence of cliques signifies cohesive interconnections among the subsets of nodes in MCC that are tightly knit together.

Correlation analysis showed that yield per plant was significantly correlated with number of tillers (0.208), panicle length (0.127) and spikelet fertility (0.134). Principal component analysis indicated that the first four principal components had eigenvalue of> 1.0 and cumulatively explained 74.3% of total variance.

Yield per plant showed a positively skewed distribution with panicle length and a nearly linear relationship with spikelet fertility. A core set of 21 genotypes capturing the entire range of phenotype for different traits, was identified from 390 genotypes using advanced M (maximization) strategy and statistically validated. Besides this, promising iso-cytoplasmic restorer lines originating from different hybrids were identified for various agromorphological traits.

Dr.Sai Sundara Krishnan G,477,12,13,Isotonic separation with an instance selection algorithm using softset: Theory and experiments,"In supervised machine learning, a training set containing labeled instances is taken by a learning algorithm to construct a model that is subsequently used for determining the class label of new instances. Isotonic separation is a supervised machine learning technique in which classification is represented as a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) with an objective of minimizing the number of misclassifications. It is computationally expensive to solve the LPP using traditional methods for a large dataset. Characteristics of the training set such as size, presence of noisy data, influence the learning algorithm and classification performance. To resolve this issue, this paper introduces a new linearithmic time algorithm called Soft set based instance selection algorithm (SOFIA) which provides a condensed dataset for a learning algorithm. And, a hybrid classification algorithm, SOFIAIS which utilizes SOFIA for instance selection and isotonic separation (IS) for classification is introduced. Two sets of experimental studies are conducted on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and the results are reported. First, experiments are performed on SOFIA-IS and the results are compared with isotonic separation and its variants. Then experiments are done on state of the art machine learning techniques by including SOFIA for instance selection and the results are compared with same techniques without SOFIA. Experimental and statistical results show that the condensed sets obtained by SOFIA are optimum, and SOFIA-IS and SOFIA based machine learning techniques are better in terms of classification accuracy, time and space complexity.",20

Characters like stem anthocyanin pigmentation on upper one-third portion, fruit green shoulder, leaflet petiole attitude with respect to main axis, leaf serration, stem pubescence, fruit shape at blossom end, fruit shape in longitudinal section and stigma lobes were important for development of identification keys. These characters were stable during two growing seasons (rabi 2014-15 and rabi 2015-16) and no variation was observed for any character in any genotype. A combination of these morphological markers could effectively utilized for distinguishing all the hybrids and their parental lines under study.",20

The stochastic behavior of such processes makes them even more demanding to scrutinize over structured networks. This paper concerns the dynamics of a new susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model incorporated with multistage infection (infection delay) and an infective medium (propagation vector) over complex networks. In particular, we investigate the critical epidemic thresholds and the infection spreading pattern using mean-field approximation (MFA) and results obtained through extensive numerical simulations.

In this paper, the stationary characteristics of an M/G/1 retrial queue is investigated where the single server, subject to active failures, primarily attends incoming calls and directs outgoing calls only when idle. The incoming calls arriving at the server follow a Poisson arrival process, while outgoing calls are made in an exponentially distributed time. On finding the server unavailable (either busy or temporarily broken down), incoming calls intrinsically join the virtual orbit from which they re-attempt for service at exponentially distributed time intervals.

An arriving Type 1 call has a preemptive priority over a Type 2 call in service, if any, and the preempted Type 2 call enters into a retrial buffer (of finite capacity). Any arriving call not able to get into service immediately will enter into the pool of repeated calls provided the buffer is not full; otherwise, the call is considered lost. The calls in the retrial pool are treated alike (like Type 1) and compete for service after a random amount of time, and can preempt a Type 2 call in service. We assume that the two types of calls arrive according to a Markovian arrival process (MAP) and the services are offered with preemptive priority rule. Under the assumption that the service times are exponentially distributed with possibly different rates, we analyze the model using matrix-analytic methods. Illustrative numerical examples to bring out the qualitative aspects of the model under study are presented.",20

Speech synthesis is a process of building machinery that can generate human-like speech from any text input to imitate human speakers. Text processing and speech generation are two main components of a text to speech system. To build a natural sounding speech synthesis system, it is essential that text processing component produce an appropriate sequence of phonemic units. Generation of sequence of phonetic units for a given standard word is referred to as letter to phoneme rule or text to phoneme rule. The complexity of these rules and their derivation depends upon the nature of the language.

During this comparative study, a rigorous analysis of static features, extracted from benign and malicious files, was conducted. For the analysis purpose, a generic framework was devised and is presented in this paper. Reference dataset (RDS) from National software reference library (NSRL) was explored in this study as a mean for filtering out benign files during analysis.

Dr.Shina Sheen,307,8,7,A novel node splitting criteria for decision trees based on theil index,The performance of detectors using decision trees can be improved by reducing the average height of the tree for faster detection. We propose a new attribute splitting criteria for decision tree construction using the concept of Theil index. The Theil index is a statistic used to measure economic inequality. Results show a decrease in average height compared to the frequently used trees like ID3 and C4.5 using impurity measure as the splitting criterion. Detection of malware using data mining techniques has been explored extensively. Techniques used for detecting malware based on structural features rely on being able to identify anomalies in the structure of executable files. These features might indicate that the file was created or infected to perform malicious activity. They are applied to a decision tree using Theil index as splitting criterion for classification as malware or benign files.,19

Dr.Shina Sheen,307,8,7,Analysis and detection of windows and android malware using structural feature based mining,"As the primary vehicle for most organized cybercrimes, malicious software or malware has become one of the most serious threats to computer systems and the Internet. With the recent advent of automated malware development toolkits, there is no need for amateur cyber-offenders to be familiar with the intricacies of coding or programming. This has led to a surge in the number of new malware threats and has created several major challenges for the Anti-virus industry. Malware has affected desktop computers and mobile devices alike. Microsoft Windows is the most widely used consumer operating system worldwide, mostly used in desktop computers. Hence a vulnerability identified in one system could compromise a large number of systems. On the other hand, the ubiquity of mobile devices has led to a growing adoption of mobile applications in a variety of application areas and 98.05% of all malware detected in 2013 targeted the Android platform, confirming both the popularity of this mobile OS and the vulnerability of its architecture. Hence, in this thesis the study and analysis of the malware affecting the above mentioned operating systems is done to find better solutions to mitigate the various threats caused by malware. The traditional methods of protecting a system through signature based detection are beset with drawbacks justifying the need to look for better and efficient solutions. This thesis aims to address the problems related to traditional methods and arrive at solutions that are more effective.

Dr.Malar B,23,3,0,Isotonic separation with an instance selection algorithm using softset: Theory and experiments,"In supervised machine learning, a training set containing labeled instances is taken by a learning algorithm to construct a model that is subsequently used for determining the class label of new instances. Isotonic separation is a supervised machine learning technique in which classification is represented as a Linear Programming Problem (LPP) with an objective of minimizing the number of misclassifications. It is computationally expensive to solve the LPP using traditional methods for a large dataset. Characteristics of the training set such as size, presence of noisy data, influence the learning algorithm and classification performance. To resolve this issue, this paper introduces a new linearithmic time algorithm called Soft set based instance selection algorithm (SOFIA) which provides a condensed dataset for a learning algorithm. And, a hybrid classification algorithm, SOFIAIS which utilizes SOFIA for instance selection and isotonic separation (IS) for classification is introduced. Two sets of experimental studies are conducted on Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and the results are reported. First, experiments are performed on SOFIA-IS and the results are compared with isotonic separation and its variants. Then experiments are done on state of the art machine learning techniques by including SOFIA for instance selection and the results are compared with same techniques without SOFIA.

Dr.Malar B,23,3,0,An online isotonic separation with cascade architecture for binary classification,"Isotonic separation (IS) is a non-parametric classification technique which constructs an isotonic function from ordered data. The rationale is to convert partially isotonic data into isotonic using a linear programming problem (LPP) and partition the input space into isotonic and non-isotonic regions to make predictions easier. Despite the widespread applications of IS in diverse domains where monotonicity exists, it has certain limitations: Firstly, computing time and the constraints of the LPP in isotonic separation increase polynomially as size of the data increases and it is highly complex to solve the LPP and obtain the model on large data sets. In order to support dynamic stream data and address the computational overhead and size of the LPP issues, this paper proposes an online isotonic separation algorithm called Cascade-IS (CIS) for binary classification.

We are investigating such systems with limited resources as formalized in descriptional complexity. A traditional descriptional complexity measure of such a system is its ins-del size. Summing up the according numbers, we arrive at the sum-norm. We show that matrix ins-del systems with sum-norm 4 and (i) maximum length 3 with only one of insertion or deletion being performed under a one-sided context, or (ii) maximum length 2 with both insertion and deletion being performed under a one-sided context, can describe all recursively enumerable languages.

Second, the conventional textural analysis methods such as Spatial Gray Level Dependency Method (SGLDM), Surrounding Region Dependence Method (SRDM), Gray-Level Run-Length Method (GLRLM) and Gray Level Difference Method (GLDM) are used to extract the features from the segmented image. A three-layer Backpropagation Neural Network classifier, trained by jack knife method and round robin method, is used to classify the extracted features into benign or malignant. The classification performances for the texture-analysis methods are evaluated using a Receiver Operating-Characteristics (ROC) analysis. The proposed algorithm and the techniques are tested on 161 pairs of digitized mammograms from MIAS database.",15

The mutants have been created in the background of Nagina 22, a popular drought- and heat-tolerant upland cultivar. As it is a pregreen revolution cultivar, as many as 573 dwarf mutants identified from this resource could be useful as an alternate source of dwarfing. A total of 541 mutants, including the macromutants and the trait-specific ones, obtained after appropriate screening, are being maintained in the mutant garden. Here, we report on the detailed characterizations of the 541 mutants based on the distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) descriptors at two different locations. About 90% of the mutants were found to be similar to the wild type (WT) with high similarity index (>0.6) at both the locations.

To overcome this issue, personalized models can be learned by using Federated multitask learning (FMTL). Due to the heterogeneous data from distributed environment, we propose a personalized model learned by federated multitask learning (FMTL) to predict the updated infection rate of COVID-19 in the USA using a mobilitybased SEIR model. Furthermore, using a mobility-based SEIR model with an additional constraint we can analyze the availability of beds. We have used the real-time mobility data sets in various states of the USA during the years 2020 and 2021. We have chosen five states for the study and we observe that there exists a correlation among the number of COVID-19 infected cases even though the rate of spread in each case is different. We have considered each US state as a node in the federated learning environment and a linear regression model is built at each node. Our experimental results show that the root-mean-square percentage error for the actual and prediction of COVID-19 cases is low for Colorado state and high for Minnesota state.

Conventional classification methods specified in literature are less efficient in classifying very small datasets with repeated attribute values. To overcome this drawback, the study explores a classification method by mining similar patterns among the instances in very small datasets. Classification by Mining Patterns (CMP) algorithm is proposed to predict the class label of the unlabelled sample by mining similar patterns among the instances in the dataset.

A botmaster can control millions of compromised systems using command & control (C&C) infrastructure. At early time IRC protocol-based botnets were used by the attackers. Recently attackers have shifted their paradigm towards HTTP-based C&C server because of several advantages and in this situation, bots frequently request and download commands from web servers which are under the control of botmaster. Since web-based C&C bots try to blend into normal HTTP traffic, it is difficult to identify HTTP botnets.

We have analyzed the botnet traffic flow statistical behaviors in a mananged environment. The proposed model effectively detects the bot irrespective of their structural properties. Our experimental evaluation based on real-world data shows that the proposed model can achieve high detection accuracy with a low false positive rate using traffic flow behaviors. We have compared the proposed model with traditional clustering techniques such as K-Means and X-Means clustering.

Dr.Regis Anne W,119,3,3,Empirical Analysis of Pair Programming Using Bloom's Taxonomy and Programmer Rankers Algorithm to Improve the Software Metrics in Agile Development,"Collaborative programming is a co-operative effort of 2 teams to n-teams to share knowledge, synergize and produce better code. Pairing, Swarming and Mobbing are the standard of agile technology which are adapted by many organizations. In this paper, software development is carried out using Pair Programming (PP) in a medium sized organization developing mobile applications using android is presented. The first method uses the Programmers Competency Matrix (PCM) based on Blooms Taxonomy to assess the skill of the programmers. Since, the pairs are chosen randomly in the PCM method, a novel algorithm is proposed to pair the programmers by Programmer Ranking Algorithm (PRA). The two proposed methods are evaluated in an organization and the results are validated. The results prove that PP definitely improves the software development process than when it is developed by individual â€¦",20

Dr.Regis Anne W,119,3,3,An Analytical model to compare the Energy and Load Improvement Ratio of a static Network over an Mobile Relay Incorporated Network,"Energy consumption in WSN is one of the most critical issues for resourceconstrained sensors. Hence, understanding the energy consumption is a key to optimize energy for maximizing network lifetime in WSN. Accordingly, energy aware design and analysis of network protocols become necessary to analyze the energy consumption behavior of the network. In this paper, an analytical model is presented for evaluating the energy consumption in terms of transmission, reception and load of the sensors both for static network and for Mobile Relay (MR) assisted network. There is a trade-off that exists between the energy consumption of a node and the performance of a network in terms of network lifetime. The analytical energy consumption model facilitates us to investigate this trade-off and inspect the parameters that affect the energy consumption for both static and MR-assisted network. By utilizing this model the energy consumption improvement (%) and the load improvement (%) are analyzed and compared. In order to validate the proposed model, the calculated results are compared with the simulated results which demonstrate good accuracy. The proposed model can be practically used to design and analyze the energy consumption of various applications in WSN.",20
Dr.Regis Anne W,119,3,3,AUTONOMOUS MOVEMENT OF MOBILE RELAYS IN WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORK TO ENHANCE NETWORK LIFETIME,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a collection of intelligent sensors that communicate and coordinate in an energy constrained environment. Due to the limited energy supply of the sensors, lifetime problems arise in static WSN. One of the potential solutions to this problem is a mobility-assisted WSN. Mobility can be introduced by adding extra entities like mobile sinks, mobile cluster-head or mobile relays (MRs) to the existing static WSN. The entities can significantly improve the functionality and performance of the WSN by making it flexible to failures, ease data collection, increase energy efficiency, enhance connectivity, improve coverage and prolong network lifetime. The need of todayâ€™s applications demands mobility-assisted WSN instead of the traditional static WSN. In this paper, we control the movement of MRs to maximize network lifetime. A distributed algorithm for controlling the movement of MRs is given and its performance is validated for the network parameters such as network lifetime and average residual energy. The proposed method shows that lifetime can be improved compared to that of a static network.",20
Dr.Regis Anne W,119,3,3,Rendezvous points selection to enhance network lifetime using mobile carrier in wireless sensor networks,"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) have a wide range of applications for todayâ€™s needs. They can be applied to simple monitoring systems to body sensor networks. Traditional, static WSN encounters problem such as energy hole problem near the sink. This is because the neighbors of sink are burdened to carry the load of the data of other sensors behind them. So they drain up their energy very quickly resulting in area being drained of energy and resulting in formation of energy hole. This leads to serious problems as the sink becomes unavailable to other sensors near the periphery of the network resulting in network partition. This problem can be solved by adding external mobile carrier (MC) of data to the sink. The work of the MC is to visit the nodes to collect data and deliver to the sink. The MC need not visit the nodes but it can visit the selected points called as rendezvous points (RPs) and collect the buffered data and deliver to the sink. The other nodes can send their data to their nearest RPs where the data will be buffered to be collected by an MC. In this paper we propose an RP based approach to continually monitor and collect data from the area of interest such that the network lifetime is prolonged. This approach is validated with existing schemes and shows considerable performance improvement. This approach prolongs network lifetime in addition to minimizing delay and energy consumption.",20
